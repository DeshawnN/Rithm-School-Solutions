	<h1>Variables and Primitives Exercises</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Create the following variables</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong><code>name</code>, which is a string set to your current name</strong></li>
				<li><strong><code>dayOfBirth</code>, which is a number set to the day of your birth month</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>See console!</p>
			<script>
				var name = "Deshawn";
				var dayOfBirth = 18;
				console.log("1. name: " + name, "dayOfBirth: " + dayOfBirth);
			</script>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>See what happens when you have multiple variables of the same name. Which one takes precedence?</strong></p>
			<p>The one defined later in the scope is the one that takes precedence, this is due to the fact that when a variable is defined, it creates a namespace for it to occupy. Namespaces are basically a unique name that points to the data stored in said variable making it impossible for 2 variables to share a name within the same scope, so when a new variable is declared with an existing name, It's treated simply as an assigment of a new value to the pre-existing namespace.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Write some JavaScript that prompt's the user for their favorite color. Once the user has submitted a favorite color, log that color to the console along with a friendly message.</strong></p>
			<button onclick="logColor();">Favorite Color Setter</button>
			<script>
				var favColor;
				function logColor() {
					favColor = prompt("Please enter your favorite color");
					console.log("3. Favorite Color is: " + favColor);
				};
			</script>
			<p>See Console!</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Create a string that contains both single quotes and double quotes.</strong></p>
			<p>See Console!</p>
			<script>
				var str = "This is a string with double quotes \"\" and single quotes ''";
				console.log("4. " + str);
			</script>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>What is the difference between null and undefined?</strong></p>
			<p><code><strong>null</strong></code> is the the intentional absense of data, which is to say, a variable that that has been declared and initialized to be treated as if it has no value at all, while <code><strong>undefined</strong></code> simply means that the the variable may or may not be declared, and if it is, it currently doesn't have a value stored.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>What is NaN in JavaScript? What is the typeof NaN?</strong></p>
			<p>NaN in JavaScript (and some other programming languages) is any non-number value. typeof NaN is "number", because ironically enough, despite NaN meaning not-a-number its still of the numerical data type.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>You can declare a variable by typing var thing;. What is the value of thing?</strong></p>
			<p>undefined, because while the variable was declared it wasn't initialized with anything to store.</p>
		</li>
