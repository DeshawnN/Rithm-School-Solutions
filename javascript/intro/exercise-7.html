	<h1>Object Basic Exercises</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<strong>Create an object that has your firstName, lastName, and occupation as keys.</strong>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Access each value from your object using both dot notation and bracket notation.</strong>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Add a key for hobby to your object. Remove the key and value for occupation.</strong>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>What is the difference between dot notation and bracket notation?</strong>
			<p>Dot notation is faster to type, therefore ideal for typical use, while Bracket Notation is a bit more keystrokes, however it allows for the evaluation of expressions to be used as keys, as well as variables.</p>
		</li>

		// 1.
		console.log("Q1.");
		var obj = {
			firstName: "Deshawn",
			lastName: "Nelson",
