	<h1>Functions: Hoisting</h1>

				<strong>What does the following code output? Why?</strong>
				<p>
					<pre>var firstName = 'Elie';

function displayFirstName(){
    var firstName = 'Tim';
    return firstName;
}

displayFirstName(); // ?

					</pre>
				</p>
				<p>It would display "Tim"</p>
			</p>
		</li>

				<strong>What does the following code output? Why?</strong>
				<p>
					<pre>function displayFirstName(){
    var firstName = 'Tim';
    return firstName;
}

displayFirstName();

console.log(firstName) // ?
						
					</pre>
				</p>
				<p>It would throw an ReferenceError stating that firstName isn't defined, because firstName doesn't exist in the global scope, where console.log() is being invoked.</p>
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>What does the following code output? Why?</strong>
				<p>
					<pre>console.log(firstName) // ?
var firstName = "Elie"
					</pre>
				</p>
				<p>It would output undefined, because its assignment statement is after the console.log().</p>
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>What does the following code output? Why?</strong>
				<p>
					<pre>console.log(firstName) // ?
firstName = 'Elie'
						
					</pre>
				</p>
				<p>It would output a ReferenceError stating that firstName isn't defined, this is because without the var keyword the firstName variable is merely being assigned, not declared, and since it isn't being declared it doesn't get hoisted.</p>
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>What does the following code output? Why?</strong>
				<p>
					<pre>function sayHi(){
    return 'Hi ' + firstName;
    var firstName = 'Elie'
}

sayHi(); // ?</pre>
				</p>
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>What does the following code output? Why?</strong>
				<p>
					<pre>function sayHi(){
    return 'Hi ' + firstName; 
    firstName = 'Elie'
}

sayHi(); // ?</pre>
				</p>
				<p>It will display "Hi undefined", because at the point of returning firstName is declared but with a value of undefined. It's also worth noting that anything after return is skipped anyway</p>
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>What does the following code output? Why?</strong>
				<p>
					<pre>sayHi() // ?

function sayHi(){
    return 'Hi!';
}</pre>
				</p>
				<p>"Hi" is displayed</p>
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>What does the following code output? Why?</strong>
				<p>
					<pre>sayHi() // ?

var sayHi = function(){
    return 'Hi!';
}</pre>
				</p>
				<p>It will throw a TypeError, because at the time of invocation, sayHi is a variable with a value of undefined, rather than a function</p>
